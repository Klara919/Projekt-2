        <h1>Why Every Man Deserves CAYO:</h1>
        <h2>The Underwear Upgrade You Didn’t Know You Needed</h2>
        <h3>Let’s Be Honest: When Was the Last Time You Thought About Your Underwear?</h3>
        <p>
            You invest in tailored suits, premium sneakers, and quality <br>
            grooming products. But when it comes to what you wear <br>
            closest to your skin, you’re still wearing whatever was <br>
            convenient—the multipack you grabbed years ago, the ones <br>
            that never really fit right, or the pair with the stretched-out <br>
            waistband you should’ve replaced ages ago.
            <br>
            <br>
            Here’s the truth: Underwear isn’t just underwear. It’s the <br>
            foundation of how you move, feel, and carry yourself <br>
            throughout the day. And if you haven’t experienced the <br>
            difference of premium underwear, you’re missing out on one <br>
            of the easiest ways to elevate your lifestyle.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is where CAYO comes in.</p>

            engineered to support without <br>
            constriction, contour without <br>
            suffocation, and enhance your natural <br>
            shape without trying too hard.
        </p>

        <div id="Luxury">
            <h2>✔ Luxury That’s Subtle, Yet Powerful</h2>

        <p>
            Luxury isn’t about loud logos or <br>
            trends. 
            <br>
            <br>
            It’s about attention to detail, perfect <br>
            craftsmanship, and a feeling that sets <br>
            you apart.
            <br>
            <br>
            CAYO is designed for men who <br>
            understand that the right underwear <br>
            changes everything—even if no one <br>
            else sees it.
