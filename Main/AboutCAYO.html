        <p>Lingerie is not just lace. Underwear is not just fabric. Loungewear is not just comfort. <br>
            They are extensions of WHO WE ARE—how we feel, how we move, how we love ourselves</p>

    <h1>FOUNDER OF CAYO</h1>

    <img src="../Photos/Me.png" alt="Me">

        <p>Growing up, I struggled with feeling confident in my own body. I didn’t <br> have the forms that society often celebrates. It left me feeling <br> disconnected from the idea of femininity, beauty, and self-love.
        <br>
        <br>
        Later in life, I made the personal decision to do something about it— <br> something that wasn’t about changing who I was, but about embracing the <br> version of myself that made me feel whole. <br>
        That experience taught me something powerful: confidence isn’t just about <br> how we look on the outside, but how we feel within. And sometimes, that <br> feeling starts with the smallest details—like what we wear underneath it all.
        <br>
        <br>
        The moment I put on a truly beautiful, well-crafted lingerie set, I <br> understood what had been missing. It wasn’t just fabric. It was <br> empowerment. It was self-expression. It was me
        <br>
        <br>
        That’s why I created CAYO—a brand that isn’t just about lingerie, <br> underwear, or loungewear, but about the feeling it gives you. I want every <br> person, no matter their shape or background, to experience that quiet <br> confidence, that unshakable beauty, that <br> outfit under an outfit that changes how you carry yourself.
        <br>
        <br>
        CAYO is more than a brand. It’s self-expression, confidence, and the power <br> of feeling sexy, loved, and seen—starting from within.</p>
